# MATLAB Practicals: Plotting & Switch-Case Operations

## Overview

This MATLAB script includes two main practical examples:

1. **Line Plot:**  
   - Plots predefined `x` and `y` values with markers.  
   - Demonstrates basic plotting with labels and title.

2. **Switch-Case Calculator & Day Identifier:**  
   - Performs arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) based on user input with error handling (e.g., division by zero).  
   - Maps numeric input (1-5) to weekdays, validating invalid inputs.

---

## Features

- Visualize data using `plot` with markers and axis labels.  
- Use `switch` statements for clean, readable conditional logic.  
- Handle user input and provide meaningful feedback/errors.  
- Format numerical output with two decimal places using `fprintf`.

## How to Run

1. Save the script (e.g., `plot_and_switch.m`).  
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the script location.  
3. Run the script with:  
   ```matlab
   >> plot_and_switch
